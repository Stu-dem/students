## About me

You can briefly describe your intrests and background here. If you can send me a cover photo and caption too that would be great. That will then go across the top of the screen.

## Current project overview

Soil nutrient and water content are important bottom-up factors that affect plant quality and subsequent trophic interactions. In insects, host plant quality has been associated with differences in oviposition preferences and herbivore performance. For biological control of invasive weeds, the understanding of the impact of environmental gradients on insect herbivore performance is of importance as it may inform when control will be less effective.   Therefore, the overall goal of my project is to unveil the impact of both water and nutrient stress on within and transgenerational life-history traits of *Neolema abbreviata* beetles on their host plant *Tradescantia fluminensis*.

## Qualifications and publications

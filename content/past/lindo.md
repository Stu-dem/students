## About me

You can briefly describe your intrests and background here. If you can send me a cover photo and caption too that would be great. That will then go across the top of the screen.

## Current project overview

Exotic grasses have proven problematic in natural veld,  reducing biodiversity and productivity. Vetiver (*Chrysopogon zizanioides*) is a fast-growing, tall exotic grass (from India) with deep roots (approximately 3m) allowing it to withstand extreme environmental conditions such as drought, frost, and flood. The species is popular worldwide for its essential oil released/extracted from the roots, and application in soil (e.g. erosion control) and water conservation (e.g. purification). We investigate the competitive ability of Vetiver under varying soil nutrients, and its allelopathic effect (chemicals that inhibit growth of neighbouring plants) on indigenous grasses, possibly through the oil, to contribute to predictions of its invasion potential.

## About me

My name is Stuart and I am a Masters student here at the UKZN Grasslands Lab. I come from Waterfall, KZN. I attended both Hillcrest Primary School and Hillcrest High School and was a scout at 1st Hillcrest Scout Group. My time there together with input from my grandparents and my teachers encouraged me to pursue a career in agriculture. But this quickly shifted to ecology after being exposed to the work that goes on in this lab.

Since then my interest in understanding terrestrial ecosystems has grown exponentially as we try to piece together complex ecosystem components and interactions. My undergraduate and graduate studies here at UKZN have sparked interests in pollination biology and networks, stats, restoration ecology and the soil-plant-herbivore gradient (guess that includes just abot everything!) And on the side I have amature academic intrests in theology, philosophy, and environmental ethics.

## Current project overview

Ecosystem stability has been studied intensely over recent decades but many of these studies have looked at one aspect or component of the ecosystem (total plant production). This is great but doesn't show the underlying changes that could be taking place. My current work is looking to change that a little by drawing on long term datasets that track biomass production at a functional group level. By tracking the change in biomass production stability of separate functional groups together with functional group compositional changes, one can gather an accurate picture of how particular land use practices alter the reliability of ecosystems.

A second aspect of this work attempts to map out the change in community composition from one state to another through time using stability. If the stability of one aspect of the ecosystem crashes substantially, how does this destabilisation translate into changes in community structure.

## Qualifications and publications

* 2014 BSc

## Future aspirations

Where do I see myself in 5 years time? Happily married with kids :grin:. And maybe I'll have a job teaching somewhere too. I'll probably still be here in South Africa but I'd like to do a collaborative cross-country/continent experiment too!

In insects, host plant quality has been associated with differences in oviposition preferences and herbivore performance. For biological control of invasive weeds, the understanding of the impact of environmental gradients on insect herbivore performance is of importance as it may inform when control will be less effective. Therefore, the overall goal of my project is to unveil the impact of both water and nutrient stress on within and transgenerational life-history traits of Neolema abbreviata beetles on their host plant Tradescantia fluminensis.\nQualifications and publications  2014 BSc 2015 BSc Hons 2018 MSc  Please also supply links to any work or theses that have been published and then I will link them in to this section.

Vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides) is a fast-growing, tall exotic grass (from India) with deep roots (approximately 3m) allowing it to withstand extreme environmental conditions such as drought, frost, and flood. The species is popular worldwide for its essential oil released/extracted from the roots, and application in soil (e.g. erosion control) and water conservation (e.g. purification). We investigate the competitive ability of Vetiver under varying soil nutrients, and its allelopathic effect (chemicals that inhibit growth of neighbouring plants) on indigenous grasses, possibly through the oil, to contribute to predictions of its invasion potential.\nQualifications and publications  2014 BSc 2015 BSc Hons 2018 MSc  Please also supply links to any work or theses that have been published and then I will link them in to this section.

I come from Waterfall, KZN. I attended both Hillcrest Primary School and Hillcrest High School and was a scout at 1st Hillcrest Scout Group. My time there together with input from my grandparents and my teachers encouraged me to pursue a career in agriculture. But this quickly shifted to ecology after being exposed to the work that goes on in this lab.\nSince then my interest in understanding terrestrial ecosystems has grown exponentially as we try to piece together complex ecosystem components and interactions. My undergraduate and graduate studies here at UKZN have sparked interests in pollination biology and networks, stats, restoration ecology and the soil-plant-herbivore gradient (guess that includes just abot everything!) And on the side I have amature academic intrests in theology, philosophy, and environmental ethics.\nCurrent project overview Ecosystem stability has been studied intensely over recent decades but many of these studies have looked at one aspect or component of the ecosystem (total plant production). This is great but doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the underlying changes that could be taking place. My current work is looking to change that a little by drawing on long term datasets that track biomass production at a functional group level. By tracking the change in biomass production stability of separate functional groups together with functional group compositional changes, one can gather an accurate picture of how particular land use practices alter the reliability of ecosystems.\nA second aspect of this work attempts to map out the change in community composition from one state to another through time using stability. If the stability of one aspect of the ecosystem crashes substantially, how does this destabilisation translate into changes in community structure.\nQualifications and publications  2014 BSc 2015 BSc Hons  Future aspirations Where do I see myself in 5 years time? Happily married with kids 😁. And maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll have a job teaching somewhere too.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"R Markdown\rThis is an R Markdown document.

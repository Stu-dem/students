      <description>About me My name is Stuart and I am a Masters student here at the UKZN Grasslands Lab. I come from Waterfall, KZN. I attended both Hillcrest Primary School and Hillcrest High School and was a scout at 1st Hillcrest Scout Group. My time there together with input from my grandparents and my teachers encouraged me to pursue a career in agriculture. But this quickly shifted to ecology after being exposed to the work that goes on in this lab.</description>
